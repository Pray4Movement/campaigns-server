## The Dedicated Server Advantage

On a dedicated server, **app + database run on the same machine**:

| Metric | Cloud (DO/Railway) | Dedicated |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| App ↔ DB latency | 2-20ms (network) | <0.1ms (local) |
| Write performance | Limited by network | NVMe speed |
| RAM for DB | 1-8GB (pay per GB) | 32-128GB (included) |
| CPU contention | Shared/noisy neighbors | All yours |

## Recommendations

| Scale | Recommendation | Why |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **10k** | DigitalOcean | Simplest, similar cost, fast writes |
| **100k** | DigitalOcean or Dedicated | DO if you value simplicity; dedicated if comfortable with ops |
| **500k+** | Dedicated | Cost savings justify ops work; local DB latency is a real advantage |

## Why Railway's Writes Are Slower

The 4-12x slower write performance is likely due to:

1. **Storage architecture** - Railway may use network-attached storage vs local NVMe
2. **WAL settings** - Stricter `synchronous_commit` settings for durability
3. **Synchronous replication** - Waiting for replica acknowledgment on every write

Railway isn't broken - it's optimized for safety over speed. DigitalOcean made different tradeoffs that favor write-heavy workloads.
