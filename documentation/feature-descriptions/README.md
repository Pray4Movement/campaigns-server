# Feature Descriptions

This folder contains documentation about how our systems work. These documents are meant to be shared with the team so we can make decisions together about how to use and extend features.

## What belongs here

Each document explains a feature or system in plain language:
- What it does and why
- How users interact with it
- Key decisions that shaped the design
- Current limitations we should be aware of

## What doesn't belong here

These documents should not include:
- Code snippets or implementation details
- Database table names or schemas
- Technical jargon that requires developer knowledge

If someone needs those details, they can look at the code directly.
